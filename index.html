					This was a small project I made to learn some basic C#. It uses the console as a canvas rather than a static wall of text. It draws in real time but is very basic. It is an ascii engine I developed to make a 'text' space game like elite. It could be used to make basic platformers, shooters etc. It uses the .Net framework with no additional libraries.

 					<td><p class="main">		
					Originally, the dungeon crawler game I was writing was going to use this engine. It is adapted from <a href="http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html">Lode's cg tutorials</a>. They are fantastic tutorials and found them very insightful into this particular method of rendering 3D. His examples are all in C++ but it wasn't too difficult porting it over to C#. There are a few optimizations I made to get it running at a consistent and smooth framerate.
