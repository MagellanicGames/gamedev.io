 		<h3 class="blue">Topdown Zombie Shooter - Java/Libgdx </h3> 						
		<p class="main">
			Definitely not very pretty but this was one of my earliest attempts at making a game. It was also the first where I made some simple graphics and sound effects. This leveraged Libdgx which is a fantastic framework to work with. The aim with this project was to do something small and simple so it could be completed. Learnt a lot about gameloops, timings, animations and just how difficult gui programming can be.

			<b>A remake is currently in development for the TIC-80 fantasy console.  The WIP is available to play <a href="https://magellanicgames.github.io/gamedev.io/zombies.html">here</a>.</b>

 		<h3 class="green" >SpaceTrade Ascii Edition - C# </h3> 								
		<p class="main">
			This was a small project I made to learn some basic C#. It uses the console as a canvas rather than a static wall of text. It draws in real time but is very basic. It is an ascii engine I developed to make a 'text' space game like elite. It could be used to make basic platformers, shooters etc. It uses the .Net framework with no additional libraries.

 		<h3 class="red" >Raycasting 3D Engine - SFML.Net  </h3>				
			<p class="main">
				Originally, the dungeon crawler game I was writing was going to use this engine. It is adapted from <a href="http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html">Lode's cg tutorials</a>. They are fantastic tutorials and found them very insightful into this particular method of rendering 3D. His examples are all in C++ but it wasn't too difficult porting it over to C#. There are a few optimizations I made to get it running at a consistent and smooth framerate.
